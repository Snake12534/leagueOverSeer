This document outlines the compilation process for the plugin.

Step 1: Get most recent SVN tree. svn co https://bzflag.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bzflag/trunk/bzflag

Step 2: Go into the plugins/ directory and create a new plugin
		sh newplug.sh leagueOverSeer

Step 3: Install libsqlite3-dev and add '-lsqlite3' to LDFLAGS in the Makefile

Step 4: Add the plugin to the build system by going
		./autogen.sh; make; make install;

And you are done! :)

If you are a website host

Step 1. Upload leagueOverSeer.php to the root of the league website and add the IPs of the servers that are allowed to report matches.

Step 2. Upload the match.php file to the 'Matches' folder and make sure you back up the old version just incase you decide to drop leagueOverSeer support.
