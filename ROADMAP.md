# Development Roadmap

LeagueOverseer is far from being finished and there are lot of things planned. If you would like to work on any of these features, start an issue in the [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/allejo/LeagueOverseer/issues) to let everyone know that you're working on that feature and we'd be able to discuss it.
