LeagueOverseer is far from being finished and there are lot of things planned. If you would like to work on any of these features, start an issue in the [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/allejo/LeagueOverseer/issues) to let everyone know that you're working on that feature and we'd be able to discuss it.
